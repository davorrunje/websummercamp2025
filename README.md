# Web Summer Camp 2025: Solving complex tasks using AI agents

## Description
In this talk, we will explore how the AG2 framework facilitates the development of AI agents that collaboratively tackle complex tasks. We will delve into AG2's capabilities, including multi-agent orchestration, tool integration, and support for both autonomous and human-in-the-loop workflows. Through practical examples, we will demonstrate how AG2 can be leveraged to build intelligent systems that efficiently solve intricate problems by coordinating multiple agents.
